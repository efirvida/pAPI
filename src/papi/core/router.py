class RESTRouter(FastAPIRouter):
    """
    Enhanced FastAPI router with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration and Addon Platform support.

    Key Features:
    - Dual Registration System: Expose routes as both HTTP endpoints and MCP tools
    - Addon-Friendly Architecture: Safe route overriding with schema preservation
    - Protocol Bridging: Native integration between REST APIs and AI agent workflows
    - Metadata Enrichment: Attach MCP-specific context to standard API routes

    Implementation Highlights:
        1. MCP Tool Exposure:
            - Routes can be registered as executable tools in AI workflows via `expose_as_mcp_tool=True`
            - Automatic schema generation for tool discovery and orchestration, provided by fastMCP
              Framework, please visit the FastMCP documentation.

        2. Addon Platform Support:
            - Global route registry enables safe cross-addon overrides
            - Version-aware route resolution maintains OpenAPI schema integrity
            - Conflict detection for path/method combinations across modules

        3. Extended Routing Capabilities:
            - Maintains native FastAPI behavior for unmodified endpoints
            - Method override protection through route signature tracking
            - Dual registration system (HTTP + MCP) without side effects

    Usage Example:
    ```python
        @router.get("/text-get", expose_as_mcp_tool=True)
        @router.put("/text-put", expose_as_mcp_tool=True)
        @router.post("/text-post", expose_as_mcp_tool=True)
        @router.delete("/text-delete", expose_as_mcp_tool=True)
        @router.patch("/text-patch", expose_as_mcp_tool=True)
        async def route_implementation():
            # expose the route_implementation as API route
            # and create the route_implementation MCP tool

                The type to use for the response.

                It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                etc.

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).
